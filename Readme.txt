Please use Makefiles associated with each technique to compile.

The main function in each technique is in the ...Test.cpp file.. use that to test the code..
Every main contains testCases and also a function called manualRun().. Use that function to test for correct implementation
of the operations of the different collision techniques.

I currently do not support rehashing(in case of full table or cycle(like in cuckoo hashing)) in these techniques.
I could not find time to do so.
